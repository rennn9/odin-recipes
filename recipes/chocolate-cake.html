    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Beat on medium speed for about two minutes until well combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the boiling water until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and let them cool completely on wire racks.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes are cool, you can frost them with your favorite chocolate frosting.</li>
